# Hanoi-Tower

Your project seems to involve creating a web-based implementation of the Tower of Hanoi puzzle. The Tower of Hanoi is a classic mathematical puzzle where the objective is to move a tower of disks from one rod to another, subject to the constraint that only one disk can be moved at a time, and no disk can be placed on top of a smaller disk.
